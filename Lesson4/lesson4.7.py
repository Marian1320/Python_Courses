# The program prompts the user their birth year. Assuming a person’s age
# is a non-negative integer not exceeding 120, output the user’s age or the
# words “Incorrect Year”. The sample outputs assume it’s currently the year
# 2016. If you are writing this program during any other year, the correct
# answers may differ. Store the value of the current year in a variable.

x=int(input())
if x < 2016:
   print(2016 - x )
